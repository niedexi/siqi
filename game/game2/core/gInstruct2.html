<p><b>See above, the groups have changed.</b>  The words/pictures for sorting have changed as well.  
The rules, however, are the same.</p>
<br>
<p>When the words/pictures belong to a group on the left press the <b>E</b> key; 
when the words/pictures belong to a category on the right, press the <b>I</b> key.  
Words/pictures belong to only one category.  An <font color=red>X</font> appears after an 
error - fix the mistake by hitting the other key.  <b>GO AS FAST AS YOU CAN.</b></p>

<div style="text-align:center">Press the <b>space bar</b> to begin.</div>
